The JCI Fellows program is able to fund one graduate student research assistant and several undergraduate research assistants starting in Fall, 2020.

To apply to become a JCI Fellow, please send an email to Philip Johnson (johnson@hawaii.edu) with the following format:

  * The subject line should be: "JCI Fellow Application".

  * The body of the email should provide a short statement on what interests you about the JCI Fellow program, and what project(s) you would be interested in working on. Note that you can pick one of the sample projects overviewed on the [Motivation](motivation.md) page, or else come up with your own proposal. Viable project candidates should address energy issues at the University of Hawaii or the state of Hawaii in some fashion.

  * Please also provide a link to your professional portfolio (preferred), or your resume.

Applications are accepted and processed on a rolling basis until all assistantships are filled.  Your application will be evaluated by a committee of faculty and staff at the University of Hawaii involved with energy and sustainability.

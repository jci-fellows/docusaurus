The JCI Fellows Program at the University of Hawaii exists to perform research, development, and education in pursuit of a net-zero University (in the short term) and a net-zero State (in the medium term).a

Making UH net-zero is an important first step toward a net-zero State. The UH currently consumes 12 MW per year. Some of the current and planned projects at the university include:

  * 5MW solar PV
  * 18MW solar PV UHWO mauka lands - AES
  * Proposed Sleeved 10MW PPA “green tariff” under negotiation w/ utility
  * Blue Pillar energy management system
  * Solar PV power plant plan
  * WIldan SEMP
  * UHERO SWITCH
  * ESCO on Holmes Hall loop
  * Efficiency Standards
  * HVAC Operational Runtimes

These initiatives create opportunities for research and development by JCI Fellows, including:

  * Data mining
  * Data analysis
  * Opportunities for energy storage
  * Grid services, including Fast Frequency Response, DR, and DER
